This is the process that should be followed to use this program to update a description.

1. Create two input files: one containing the old string and one containing the new string
2. Run the program. A sample run looks like this:
```
source ./env/bin/activate
cd v2
python3 update_description_v2.py --find ./inputs/old_address_4.txt --replace_with ./inputs/new_address.txt --all
```
3. Once finished, manually fix any descriptions that were missed for any reason. Note that the description of YouTube Shorts videos may be different than those of regular longform videos.
4. Update the YouTube video default description here: https://studio.youtube.com/channel/UC0Il3poeADV0QEio9GWPEHw
    - from here, go to Settings > Upload Defaults
5. Update "PO Box" location in shopify: https://admin.shopify.com/store/yawtcv-e3/settings/locations
