These are the docs for the YouTube Description Updater, written by Ryan Quinlan.

In order to run the application, the environment 'env3' must be activated using `source env3/bin/activate`
Inside of the application folder (currently v2), there are 4 important folders:
  1. update_description_v2.py: this is the main python script that is run
  2. client_secrets_v2.json: this file contains a JSON object that has all client ID and client secret info. This is necessary to authenticate oneself to YouTube. These are known as Oauth 2.0 credenitals and must be obtained here: https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials?project=meta-scanner-228205&folder&organizationId
  3. video_ids.txt: this file contains a list object of all of the IDs of every YouTube video I have. It is not currently being kept up to date, but could easily be automated if needed. I would just rather not run code to obtain them freshly all the time because I have an API limit from YouTube that I need to adhere to.
  4. update_descrription_v2.py-oauth2.json: this file is automatically generated on a correct run of the program

In order to run the program:
  1. you must be signed into the google account of the YouTube channel you wish to modify.
  2. the credentials specified in client_secrets_v2.json MUST be up to date. You can obtain new ones here if the first run returns 403 Forbidden: https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials?project=meta-scanner-228205&folder&organizationId
    - If new credentials are obtained, replace old ones in client_secrets_v2.json
  3. You must be in the virtual environment env3
  4. Type `python3 update_description_v2.py`
  5. If the program authenticates successfully but it has been a while since it was run, the command line may display a link that needs to be copied and pasted into the browser to finish authentication. This link leads to a consent page that I had to set up. It is like an official app where you have to give the app permission to make changes to your YouTube channel. (see consent_screen.png) Once you say yes, then the program will run.
